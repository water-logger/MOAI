# Main Tutorial

Alright, so you wanna learn about the Linux/Unix shell? This is not the right place to be, but I can tell you about some stuff.

## Terminal Emulators

There are many terminal emulators out there, but I'm gonna tell you about the ones I use.

#### Termux

If you have an Android 7+ device, you can install terminal emulator named "Termux".
It's basiclly the best terminal emulator for Android. It has a ton of packages, it can make virtual machines, and it can even be used for ethical hacking.

#### WSL

Just the normal Linux shell for whatever Linux distribution you choose but worse. WSL stands for "Windows Subsystem for Linux" which by the meaning, you can probably tell which operating system it's for. It has most of the packages that the normal Linux distibutions have including but not limited to: dosbox, git, zsh, dialog, nano, vim, vi, and emacs.

#### Termux and Andronix

Now, Termux and Andronix make a good team. With Andronix, you can choose from multiple different Linux distributions to emulate. Now, here's where Termux comes in, in Andronix you copy a command which allows you to actually connect to the Linux distribution you chose. Next you paste the command into Termux and wait for everything to install. When everything is installed, you're finished.
